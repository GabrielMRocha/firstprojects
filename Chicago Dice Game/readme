How to Score
Game play consists of 11 rounds. Each round has a target score. The first roundâ€™s target score is 2, the second round is 3 and so on up to round 11 with a target score of 12.

If a player rolls the target score on his turn for that round, he scores that total.

For example, if it is round 8, the target score is 9. If a player rolls any combination that add up to 9 (e.g. 4-5, 6-3), he scores a 9.

If a player does not roll the target score, he earns zero points for that round.Dice in order
