Project made to learn how to operate with PostGRESQL databases and website deployment with Python, HTML and CSS

Basic concept:

1- user inputs their email and height data
2- the data gets stored into a PostGRESQL database
3- the user receives an email with his info and with the average height of all data stored in the database.

Next steps:
- Add complexity to the overall idea of the app
- Total re-do of the layout, using JavaScript this time
